# From Matter to Subatomic Particles.( Anti-Matter too!)

##  Every thing which has matter and occupies space, has mass, and is called Matter.


1. _Elements_ : Matter is further broken down to **_Elements_**.  They are the building blocks of everything.

2. _Molecules_ :Elements are further broken down to different **_Molecules_** which has properties that
make up the element.

3. _Atoms_ : Molecules are further made of **_Atoms_**, which come in trillions of
combinations of the following particles, to make up almost every thing in the
universe.

	1. A **_nucleus_** in the middle.
	2. **_Electrons_**  orbiting the nucleus.

_Nucleus_ : The nucleus is made up of smaller particles of two types :
	
1. **_Protons_**, which has positive charge,

2. **_Neutrons_**, which have no charge,

3. **_Electrons_**, which have negative charge.

4. The Protons, Neutrons and Electrons are collectively known as **_Subatomic
Particles_**.
	
**_Quarks_** : Protons and Neutrons can be broken down to smaller
	   particles, called _Quarks_.
	
**_Leptons_** : Electrons can't be broken down. They are elementary
	   particles called _Leptons_.
	
The quarks inside the protons and neutrons are bound together by a gum
like particle, called **_Gluons_**.
