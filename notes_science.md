## Chapter 1 : Transportation in animals and plants.

### Blood.

1. Blood is a body's major medium of transport.

2. It does a lot of functions that are essentialfor life like:
	* Carrying oxygen to all parts of the body.
	* Collecting wastes such as urea and Carbon-Di-Oxide.
	* It distributes energy-rich vitamins and minerals to all parts if the body.

3. Heart is a pump that pumps blood to all parts of the body.

4. Blood vessels( like artries and veins) help the blood to circulate.

### 5. Constituents of blood
Blood is made up of the following

	* Plasma 
	* Red Blood Cells ( RBC ) 
	* White Blood Cells ( WBC )
	* Platelets

6. Functions of constituents of blood :
	1. Plasma : Transporting substances through blood & Helping the blood to clot.
	2. Red Blood Cells : Carry oxygen through body.
	3. White Blood Cells : Protect body against infection by destroying foreign materials.
	4. Platelets : Clotting of blood.


7. Artries carry oxygenated blood from heart to body.

8. Veins carry De-oxygenatd blood from body to heart.

9. Capillaries connect Artries and veins. 


### Heart.

1. The heart has four chambers, namely :
	1. Right Auricle, Right Ventricle (Upper part)
	2. Left Auricle, Left Ventricle (Lower part), Which are separated by a wall (septum).

2. It has 5 pipe like structures( Helping in the transportation of blood ) , which are :
	1. superior vena cava,
	2. inferior vena cava,
	3. Aorta,
	4. Pulmonary artery,
	4. Pulmonary vein

3. The phase when both the oxygenated and the de-oxygenated blood enters the heart is called Systole.

4. The phase when they are pumped out is called Diastole
