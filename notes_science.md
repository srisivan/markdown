## Chapter 1 : Transportation in animals and plants.

> ### Blood.

1. Blood is a body's major medium of transport.

2. It does a lot of functions that are essentialfor life like:
	* Carrying oxygen to all parts of the body.
	* Collecting wastes such as urea and Carbon-Di-Oxide.
	* It distributes energy-rich vitamins and minerals to all parts if the body.

3. Heart is a pump that pumps blood to all parts of the body.

4. Blood vessels( like artries and veins) help the blood to circulate.

### 5. Constituents of blood
Blood is made up of the following

	* Plasma 
	* Red Blood Cells ( RBC ) 
	* White Blood Cells ( WBC )
	* Platelets

6. Functions of constituents of blood :
	1. Plasma : Transporting substances through blood & Helping the blood to clot.
	2. Red Blood Cells : Carry oxygen through body.
	3. White Blood Cells : Protect body against infection by destroying foreign materials.
	4. Platelets : Clotting of blood.


7. Artries carry oxygenated blood from heart to body.

8. Veins carry De-oxygenatd blood from body to heart.

9. Capillaries connect Artries and veins. 


> ### Heart.

1. The heart has four chambers, namely :
	1. Right Auricle, Right Ventricle ( in the upper part )
	2. Left Auricle, Left Ventricle ( in the lower part )
	3. They are seperated by a wall (septum)

2. It has 5 pipe like structures( Helping in the transportation of blood ) , which are :
	1. superior vena cava
	2. inferior vena cava
	3. Aorta
	4. Pulmonary artery
	4. Pulmonary vein

3. The phase when both the oxygenated and the de-oxygenated blood enters the heart through the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava is called Diastole.

4. The phase when they are pumped out of pulmonary artery and aorta is called Systole


# Physics.

## Chapter 1 : Light

> ### Properties of light 

1. Rectilinear Propagation of light : Light moves in straight lines.
2. Reflection of light : When hit a  surface, it bounces off.
	1. Regular Reflection : When hit on a well polished, smooth surface, the light bounces off it evenly.
	2. Irregular Reflection : When hit on a irregular, rough surface, the light gets dispersed off in all directions unevenly.

> ###  Types of mirrors :
There are two types of mirrors, they are :
	1. Plane mirrors.
	2. Circular mirrors.
		1. Concave mirrors.
		2. Convex mirrors.

> ###  Types of Images :
Images are classified the way they appear on the mirror. There are two types, namely :
	1. Virtual Images ( The image formed on a plane mirror or screen. The rays do not actually meet. They get reflected away.Virtual images are always erect.)
	2. Real Images ( The image formed on curved side of a polished spoon. The rays actually meet in front of the spoon.Real images are always inverted)

> ### Nature of Image formed on a plane mirror.
1. The image formed on the mirror is laterally inverted. Meaning they are inverted from left to right.
2. The image formed on the mirror is equidistant from the object.
3. The image is virtual and erect.
4. Same size of the object.
